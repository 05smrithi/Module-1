# Experiment: Addition of Two Complex Numbers in Python

## 🧠 AIM

To write a Python program for adding two complex numbers, where the user inputs the numbers using the `eval()` function.

---

## 📝 ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Use `eval()` to get two complex numbers as input from the user.
3. Print the complex numbers entered by the user.
4. Perform the addition of the two complex numbers using the `+` operator.
5. Print the sum of the two complex numbers.
6. Terminate the program.

---

## 💻 PROGRAM

```python

#Reg.No:
#Name:

A = eval(input())
B = eval(input())

print(f"A is {A}")
print(f"B is {B}")

sum_complex = A + B

print(f"Sum is {sum_complex}")
```
##OUTPUT
A is (3+4j)
B is (1+2j)
Sum is (4+6j)

## RESULT
Thus the python program for  adding two complex numbers has been implemented and executed successfully.
