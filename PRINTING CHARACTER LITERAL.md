# Experiment No: 3 â€“ Printing Character Literals

## AIM  
To write a Python program for printing the character literals.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Define the characters `'S'` and `'k'` using character literals.  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the characters `'S'` and `'k'`.  
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-
# Name-
# Write your code here

char1 = 'S'  
char2 = 'k'  

print(char1)
print(char2)
```
