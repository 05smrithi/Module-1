**Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Reading and Printing a Complex Number**

**AIM**

To write a Python program to read two integers from the user and print them as a complex number.

**ALGORITHM** 
1. Start the program.
2. Read the real part of the complex number from the user using input() and convert it to an integer.
3. Read the imaginary part of the complex number from the user using input() and convert it to an integer.
4. Use the complex() function to combine the two integers into a complex number.
5. Display the complex number using the print() function.
6. End the program.

**PROGRAM**

**212223060265

SMRITHI K**

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=complex(a,b)
print(c)
